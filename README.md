# 1101-Sequence-Detector
In this project, we aim to detect the Sequence “1101”, which means the system should 
generate a high output signal when this exact bit pattern appears in the input stream. The 
complexity of sequence detection increases with longer patterns or overlapping sequences, 
but the principles remain the same. The choice of hardware implementation significantly 
affects the performance, reliability, and power consumption of the design.
